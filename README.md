## About us
Hokie Talk is a completely student-run podcast at Virginia Tech. Professors and students are interviewed about their expertise, opinions, and stories! Episodes are then made free to anyone who chooses to listen.

Most students will go their four years at Virginia Tech not knowing what most professors at Virginia Tech do, which we seek to change given how close and accessible they are. Hokie Talk seeks spread their knowledge to the Virginia Tech community.

And many students who have previously been interviewed have had interesting and inspiring life stories and projects they've liked to share, however, there is no requirement for a student to be a guest.

## Who made this?

This website was created by Ethan Kies, but the Hokie Talk podcast has been a collaborative effort from Aziz Malouche, Ruba Gari, and Ethan Kies.
